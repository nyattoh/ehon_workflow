# README.mdの使い方と設定について (2025-09-03 11:38Z)

README.mdに使い方を書いて欲しい。フォークして自分のリポジトリに入れてから、stories/sample.txtに題名とあらすじを書き込んでpushするとお話ができる、でもsecret設定とかpages設定が必要だっていうのも

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating README Instructions**

I need to update README.md with usage instructions in Japanese. The user wants clear guidance on forking, editing stories/sample.txt, and pushing changes to generate a story. I'll also mention the secrets and GitHub Pages settings are needed. Since this is a single edit, it’s not complex, so I can skip creating a todo list. However, I should provide a status update: "I’ll update README with usage docs and then apply the necessary patch."
**Performing Status Update**

I’m going to do a status update: "I’ll scan the workflow and scripts to document secrets and setup, then update the README." This means I’ll first double-check everything to make sure the documentation is accurate. After that, I’ll proceed with the updates, ensuring that all necessary information is included. It feels important to keep everything clear for the user, so they have the best experience possible!</details></think>

I'll review the workflow and scripts to identify required secrets and setup steps, then update `README.md` with clear usage instructions. Proceeding to open the relevant files.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating usage instructions**

I need to update the README.md with usage instructions based on the user's request in Japanese. They want to know how to fork the repo, write the title and synopsis in stories/sample.txt, and push their changes while also emphasizing the need for secret settings and GitHub Pages settings.

I’ll expand the two lines we have to include these details, particularly mentioning the optional GEMINI_API_KEY secret and how the workflow functions if that key isn’t present. This will help users understand how to work with the project.
**Clarifying README updates**

I need to clarify that the secret is optional for generating AI content; if it’s omitted, template content will be used. The user emphasized that both secret settings and GitHub Pages settings are necessary.

For the code, Pages settings are essential because GitHub Pages requires it, such as using the "pages: write" environment for the workflow. I’ll instruct users to enable Pages on the first run and set the Source to GitHub Actions.

I also need to explain how to edit `stories/sample.txt` and push changes to generate the site on GitHub Pages. Covering local runs could be helpful but isn't strictly necessary.
**Instructing on process**

The user’s request is simple: I need to provide clear instructions. There's also the `generate_story.py` that creates Marp Markdown and images, which may not be referenced in the current workflow that uses `generate_html_story.py`.

I should mention extra features, like how it auto-creates a sample story file if no changes are made, although that detail isn't strictly necessary.

Step-by-step instructions for the user would include forking the repository on GitHub and setting the secret for `GEMINI_API_KEY`, with a general mention of [Google AI Studio] as a link. I’ll remember to format URLs correctly while adhering to markdown rules.
**Providing GitHub instructions**

I need to clarify that I can't browse, but I can suggest typical links, like for "GitHub Pages settings." I can't know the specific owner, but I’ll instruct users to navigate to their repository Settings > Pages to set Build and deployment to GitHub Actions.

I should remind them that the workflow triggers upon push to any 'stories/**/*.txt' file, not just `sample.txt`, although they should be aware of committing `stories/sample.txt` specifically. 

I'll mention that pushes to any branch trigger the workflow, and I might want to highlight the default branch in this context.
**Updating README.md content**

I need to provide a clear format for `sample.txt`, suggesting it starts with "題名: ..." and "あらすじ: ...", while cautioning about using UTF-8 encoding. If the `GEMINI_API_KEY` is missing, it will default to a simple template.

It’s important to guide users on enabling Actions and setting workflow permissions, even if it's not necessary. I should explain how the workflow operates and include optional local development instructions, but keep it concise since the user didn't explicitly request that.

Finally, I’ll craft the README content in Japanese, maintaining correct formatting and indentation throughout the document.
**Preparing README.md patch**

I’m crafting a patch for the README.md that will enhance the documentation. First, I’ll provide a description of the project, explaining how GitHub Actions generates HTML slides for GitHub Pages based on the `stories/*.txt` files. 

Next, I’ll create a bullet list under "### 必要なもの" and make sure to emphasize the importance of setting the `GEMINI_API_KEY`, as it is necessary for AI generation. 

I’m also constructing instructions that detail how to enable GitHub Pages and set up secrets, along with a clear step-by-step guide to formatting the sample story and troubleshooting common issues. 

After forming the patch, I’ll apply it, ensuring proper encoding and formatting throughout.</details></think>

I'll add detailed usage instructions to README, covering forking, editing `stories/sample.txt`, required GitHub Pages settings, and the `GEMINI_API_KEY` secret. Then I'll save the edits.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating README details**

I'm updating the README and planning to run a quick lint check, followed by calling read_lints. It looks like we only need one tool call, so it's good that we don't have to worry about max parallel tool calls. The README content will be in Japanese, which is great! I should note that the pages environment is created automatically by the workflow's steps and emphasize that "Set Build and deployment to GitHub Actions" is necessary. Lastly, I should avoid heavy formatting but can use bullet lists if needed.
**Summarizing README updates**

The Markdown_spec indicates I should use headings and bullet lists, but I also need to keep verbosity minimal while adhering to the guidelines. Even though the instructions say to avoid outputting code to the user, I’m just summarizing the updates to the README and not actually displaying any code. So, it looks like I'm all set to run read_lints now and make sure everything is in order!</details></think>

I updated README with clear setup and usage instructions. I'll run a quick check for any linter/format issues on the changed file.

- I added usage guidance to `README.md`: how to fork, edit `stories/sample.txt`, push to trigger the workflow, and view the published GitHub Pages.
- Included required settings: set Pages to “GitHub Actions” and add `GEMINI_API_KEY` as a repo secret (optional; without it, a template is used).
- Added local run instructions and a brief troubleshooting section.

Would you like me to add screenshots or a status badge for the workflow?
